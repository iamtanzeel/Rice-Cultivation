# About the project
This dashboard visualize the rice cultivation in India. 


Production - Refers to the total amount of product harvested from a given plot of land. Most often expressed as a unit of volume, count or weight (bushels, pounds, kilos, cases, sacks, etc.) per unit of land (acre, hectare, mu, etc.).

Yield - Refers to the volume, count or weight of final usable product, net of dockage or deductions for unusable product, low quality, or otherwise rejected per unit of land.


# Highlights
1. The dataset contains information from 1966 to 2017.
2. The Area refers to the Rice Area in 1000 ha.
3. The Production is in 1000 tons.
4. The Rice Yield is in kg per ha.

# Insights:
1. West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab are major Rice Producing states, with combined production of 1 lakh 32 thousand tons.
2. Rice yield has shown a steady growth but Rice production is has not increased as much. The gap between yield and production increases year by year.
3. Rice yield and Production in Chattisgarh has seen as big drop from 2016 to 2017. 
4. Bihar had a big jump in Rice Yield in 2010-2011 but the production remained steady.
5. Murshidabad, West Dinjapur and Hoogly are top rice producing Districts in West Bengal.
6. Basti, Gorakhpur and Deoria are top rice producing Districts in Uttar Pradesh.
